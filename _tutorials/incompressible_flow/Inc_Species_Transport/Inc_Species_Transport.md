## Goals

Upon completing this tutorial, the user will be familiar with adding passive species transport equations to an incompressible or compressible flow problem. The necessary steps and config options will be explained with the example of a simple 2D incompressible mixing channel system. Output options will be explained as well.

Limitations: Mixture dependent fluid properties are not available yet. The mass diffusion coefficient can only be chosen as a constant for a all species transport equations.

## Resources

The resources for this tutorial can be found in the [incompressible_flow/Inc_Species_Transport](https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials/tree/master/incompressible_flow/Inc_Species_Transport) directory in the [tutorial repository](https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials). You will need the configuration file ([species3_primitiveVenturi.cfg](https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials/tree/master/incompressible_flow/Inc_Species_Transport/species3_primitiveVenturi.cfg)) and the mesh file ([primitiveVenturi.su2](https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials/tree/master/incompressible_flow/Inc_Species_Transport/primitiveVenturi.su2)).

The mesh is created using [gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) and a respective `.geo` script is available to recreate/modify the mesh [primitiveVenturi.geo](https://github.com/su2code/Tutorials/tree/master/incompressible_flow/Inc_Species_Transport/primitiveVenturi.geo). The mesh is fully structured (i.e. only contains Quadrilateral elements) with 3364 elements and 3510 points. A progression towards walls is used but the mesh resolution is for demonstration purposes only. The small size also makes it ideal for code development.

## Prerequisites

The following tutorial assumes you already compiled `SU2_CFD` in serial or parallel, please see the [Download](/docs_v7/Download/) and [Installation](/docs_v7/Installation/) if that is not done yet. Additionally it is advised to perform an entry level incompressible tutorial first, as this tutorial only goes over species transport

## Background

The geometry with two separate inlets, a junction where the two feeders meet and a nozzle leading to an outlet, resembles loosely a venturi mixer. The geometry massively simplifies these design principles. The material properties and provided mass fractions at the inlet are for demonstration purposes.

## Problem Setup

The material properties of the incompressible mean flow represent air:
- Density (constant) = 1.1766 kg/m^3
- Viscosity (constant) = 1.716e-5 kg/(m-s)
- Inlet Velocities (constant) = 1 m/s in normal direction
- Outlet Pressure (constant) = 0 Pa

The SST turbulence model is used with the default settings of freestream turbulence intensity of 5% and a turbulent-to-laminar viscosity ratio of 10.

The material properties specific to the species transport equations are:
- Mass Diffusivity (constant) = 1e-3 m^2/s
- Mass fractions at the eastern inlet: 0.5, 0.5
- Mass fractions at the northern inlet: 0.6, 0.0

## Configuration File Options

All available options concerning species transport are listed below as they occur in the [config_template.cfg](https://github.com/su2code/SU2/blob/master/config_template.cfg).

The options as of now are fairly limited. Species transport is switched on by setting `KIND_SCALAR_MODEL= SPECIES_TRANSPORT`. The `DIFFUSIVITY_MODEL= CONSTANT_DIFFUSIVITY` is currently the only available therefore the only additional choice the value of `DIFFUSIVITY_CONSTANT`. For the `SCHMIDT_NUMBER_TURBULENT` please consult [the respective theory](/docs_v7/Theory/#species-transport).

The number of species transport equations is not set individually but deduced from the number of values given in the respective lists for species options. SU2 checks whether the same amount of values is given in each option and solves the appropriate amount of equations. `MARKER_INLET_SPECIES` is one of these options and has to be used alongside a usual `MARKER_INLET`. For outlets, symmetries or walls this is not necessary. 

The option `SPECIES_USE_STRONG_BC` should be left to `NO` and is an experimental option where a switch to strongly enforced boundary conditions can be made.

For `CONV_NUM_METHOD_SPECIES= SCALAR_UPWIND` a second order MUSCL reconstruction and multiple limiters are available.

The `TIME_DISCRE_SPECIES` can be either an implicit or explicit euler and a CFL reduction coefficient `CFL_REDUCTION_SPECIES` compared to the regular `CFL_NUMBER` is available.

The inital species mass fractions are given by the list `SPECIES_INIT= 1.0, ...`.

`SPECIES_CLIPPING= YES` with the respective lists for min and max enforces a strict lower and upper limit for the mass fraction solution used by the solver.

```

```

For the screen, history and volume output multiple straight forward options were included. Whenever a number is used at the end of the keyword, one for each species (starting at zero) can be added.
```
SCREEN_OUTPUT= RMS_SPECIES_0, ..., MAX_SPECIES_0, ..., BGS_SPECIES_0, ..., \
               LINSOL_ITER_SPECIES, LINSOL_RESIDUAL_SPECIES, \
               SURFACE_SPECIES_0, ..., SURFACE_SPECIES_VARIANCE
```

For `HISTORY_OUTPUT` the residuals are included in `RMS_RES` and the linear solver quantities in `LINSOL`. The surface outputs can be included with `SPECIES_COEFF` or `SPECIES_COEFF_SURF` for each surface individually.

For `VOLUME_OUTPUT` no extra output field has the be set. The mass fractions are included in `SOLUTION` and the volume residuals in `RESIDUAL`.

All available output can be printed to screen using the `dry-run` feature of SU2:
```
$ SU2_CFD -d <config-filename>.cfg
```

## Running SU2

The simulation can be run in serial using the following command:
```
$ SU2_CFD species3_primitiveVenturi.cfg
```
or in parallel with your preferred number of cores (for this small case not more than 4 cores should be used):
```
$ mpiexec -n <#cores> SU2_CFD species3_primitiveVenturi.cfg
```

## Results

The case converges nicely as expected on such a simple case and mesh.

Note that there is still some unphysical mass fraction fluctuation for Species_0 at the junction corner. This becomes much less apparent by using `MUSCL_SPECIES = YES` but does not fully disappear.

Velocity magnitude field along which the species are transported. For a much less homogenous mixture at the outlet one could decrease the `DIFFUSIVITY_CONSTANT` which makes for a more interesting optimization problem.

## Additional remarks

An in depth optimization of this case with addition of the FFD-box, gradient validation and some more steps can found [here](/tutorials/Species_Transport/).
